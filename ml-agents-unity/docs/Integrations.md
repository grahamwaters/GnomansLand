# Game Integrations
ML-Agents provides some utilities to make it easier to integrate with some common genres of games.

## Match-3
The [Match-3 integration](Integrations-Match3.md) provides an abstraction of a match-3 game board and moves, along with
a sensor to observe the game state, and an actuator to translate the ML-Agent actions into game moves.

## Interested in more game templates?
