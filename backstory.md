# The Story line of the game:
 A long series of short snippets that describe random things that the Agent (now referred to as the character Greg) encounters, thinks about, or does in the world.

## Chapter 1 - Neo Man, the coming rain
The scent of the garden in the morning was the first thing that Greg noticed when he woke up. It was time to start on his grand adventure. He grabbed his books and started reading up on gardening. It was important, he thought, to be ready for everything. Greg learned a few things from the books. You plant your garden in the morning on the first of the month and day of the week where the sun shines above the tree. That is your key to success. Hmm he thought... okay. I am going to remember that. He picked his spot in front of his cave facing the clearing where he always woke up. He started to dig with his bare hands. It was his duty to take care of the woods. His first job was to plant a garden. Greg finished planting his garden, and decided to walk around and look at the world. He thought it looked nice. There was only one problem.
A huge storm was approaching. A day later, the storm was still approaching. It was like a nightmare. Greg decided that he should do something. He decided to do his best to fix the weather. He knew what he had to do. Greg went and set up his experiment in his garden. He walked up to the tree line and planted seeds.greg wondered why he did not do it sooner.
After planting his garden, Greg started to think of things to do. He went down to the lake and dug a hole in the cracked mud by the shore line. He started to fill up the hole with water and let it fill up. He thought this would bring rain soon. As he walked back to his garden he saw a hiker, who was carrying a backpack.
What an adventure, Greg thought... this is going to do wonders for me. I thought that the last world would be more challenging. He walked back to his garden and picked up a stack of books. He started to read them. Greg was only a few chapters in, when he saw another hiker. He was older, so he was going to be his first official mentor. He walked over and looked at the man in the light of the sunset.
"Hello, I am Greg,"said the man. "Nice to meet you." "My name is Ron. Nice to meet you too."
"Well, Ron," said Greg. "I find I am struggling with..." "My goodness, my son. I was wondering when you were going to come around. I have been waiting for you for a long time. " I guess this is good news, Greg thought. Maybe my adventure really is starting. "What do you plan to do?" asked Ron. "I am here to have fun and explore, but I do have a problem. My garden has flooded." "There is nothing to worry about, Greg. I have been through this before. Let me take a look at your garden." Ron looked at his garden, took note of the flooding, and said,"Greg, I will see you tomorrow. We will talk after my meeting. "
As he walked away, Greg decided to get some sleep. He started reading again, but he could not sleep. He kept thinking about the hiker. "Maybe he is not real. I did hear about this before. This is a video game and there are going to be fake people here. Maybe this is a test. They want to see if I pass or fail. Okay... the plant seeds will cause rain. That should be easy. Thank you Neo Man. That was a good tip."
Greg went to bed. He thought about planting more seeds. He thought that he could now have nice garden. Maybe what Ron said was true. Maybe Neo Man would be coming soon. He fell asleep and started dreaming. His dream sounded just like a world that he would like to live in. There was no way to know anything until he woke up in his garden the following day. Everything was brighter the day after the garden flooded. Today is the first of the month.
Greg started thinking about the hiker again. Greg had a lot of time on his hands. There was nothing to do, but wait for an animal to walk by. That was his last meal. It was a lonely life for Greg. The only thing that kept him company was the memories of Neo Man. He waited for Ron, he waited for Neo Man, he waited.
"Can I do anything?" asked Greg. "There is nothing to worry about." said Ron. "Why have you come to me with nothing? Nothing can help you." "I am here only to offer you a chance. I am here to give you my wisdom. Will you walk with me Greg ? Will you be my apprentice?" "I will do anything you say. I do not have anything to live for anymore." "That is the way to start, Greg. You must trust me. It is important to have a positive attitude." "Okay."
"To be a gardener, you must start at the roots. You must dig a hole in the ground. Dig a hole and place your seeds. Planting seeds is the very beginning." "Oh, this is easy. Thank you Neo Man."
## Chapter 2 - Natural life
Greg was trying to get rid of a weed that grew in his garden. The rain had to help him with this. He had to learn something from all of this. He said to himself, "I will check all of these books. Maybe the answer is here."
He opened the book on garden design. He read all of the pages. There was nothing that he could help with. "Maybe watering something would help." It did not help. The thing just got stronger. It was four feet tall. He did not have the strength to chop it down. All of his power was gone.
Greg took a look at the clock. The time was 7:30 pm. His mentor was late. "Maybe he is asleep,"Greg said. It is a real possibility. I cannot wait forever though. I should try something to eat. I am hungry. That was a few hours later. He finally decided to go to the clearing to see if Ron was there already. He walked down. He saw him walking back. He did not look like a hiker anymore. He looked beaten. Greg did not say anything about it. He was walking with his head down. He seemed like he was defeated. ''Hello Greg," said Ron. "I have some bad news for you." "What is it?" "This world is not a video game. This is real."
Greg thought to himself, "False alarm? That makes absolutely no sense. I have been at this for years. That would mean this is not a test. What is going on? Did I wait for nothing?" Greg saw Ron started to cry a little bit. Ron was fighting back tears, but he could not stand his emotions anymore. He had to start running. But he could not... His power was gone. He collapsed on the ground and started to sob.
"The only thing you have come to me for is just a test. Did you get a chance to check my garden? No? That is okay, I do not expect you to look at it." Greg thought about Neo Man. He said, "How could this be a test? I never heard of something like this. Why are you not the one running? Are the plants supposed to hurt me?" He thought, "What a fool. I could have seen this coming, but I chose to ignore it. It is all my fault. I lost my power and my friends. I never asked why they came here. I never asked..."
He went over to him. "I have to admit this is not what I expected. My disappointment is not even as low as I thought it would be. I am not mad. I feel like this is what is supposed to happen. Let me help you up." Greg said, "No, you can't help me. You cannot do anything for me anymore. I want to be alone now. I have wasted a lot of time." "I will come back. I will walk with you." "No," said Ron, "You should not come back. It would be better if you never came back. Please, do not help me. I have nothing to live for. I do not know anything about me." "That is not true, I can help you. I am not mad at you. I know that you are going through something hard and I want to help you."
"You may think you do, but you really don't. Life was hard enough for me. Now everything is different. I do not know how to cope with this. I am so lonely now. I can't sleep anymore. I need to nap now. I need to sleep." "Ron, this is my fault. I am here to help you. I have to do it. I have no choice."
"You do have a choice. This is new and different to me. I need time to get used to all of this. Forget about everything. Leave it be. Whatever this is, it is not supposed to be like this. Please forgive me. As a gardener I have to keep trying." "Wait..." he said. "Why is this happening? Ron, please tell me what is going on."
"Please, I need to nap now. You should do the same. I will go to sleep. You should do the same." He started walking away. He walked four steps before it happened, Ron turned around to face Greg, "I lied. I am not going to sleep." he said, "I will be back Greg. The garden will be the way it was when the hiker showed me." He turned and walked away again. Greg was still confused. He tried to figure out what was going on. He waited there for six hours.
Ron returned with a new plan. He set his plan in motion. He turned around and looked at Greg who was still standing there waiting. He walked back over to him. "We have to do it all over again," he said. "I made some changes." "What changed?" "I took certain leaves and lids off of the soil and placed them on the other side of the plants. Everyone of these plants is now roots to one big tree. All I did was make them grow. Everything kept growing until all of the plants grew together in one big mighty tree." "What is the point of all of this?" Greg asked. "There is no point to this. We are just doing this all wrong. I am going to show you what a real gardener can do." "I see that Ron. I do not think I am ready for something this big though." "You will be ready. This will be easy." Ron said, "See how strong I am? The plant is too strong. The plants are too strong. I am too weak. I cannot move them." "It is a simple process Greg. We just have to pull the weeds out. If we pull the right weed, everything will be alright. If not, we will have to fix it. All we have to do is pull out the weed. You should have a look at your garden."
Greg followed him around for the rest of the night. It was about four in the morning when Greg had a talk with Ron, "You should have stayed with me. I have been doing things wrong all night long. I have been pulling the wrong plants. I have been trying to save them when all I should have been doing was letting nature take its course. I think I know what to do now. I will just pull them out to the center of the clearing, that way they will not worry anymore."
Greg did exactly what he wanted. He cut them all down and simply pulled them out of the ground. Ron smiled and laughed to himself as he went to work on cleaning up the mess he made. It was a fairly easy process. The plants were harder to deal with. But it was all over. Greg sent the weeds to their appropriate homes. He smiled and sat back down on the bench. He looked to the center of the clearing to see if Ron was there anymore. He did not see him anywhere. It was just him and the plants. He thought it was odd. He stood up on the bench and looked around. He did not see Ron anywhere. He started walking back to the bench when he did see him. He did not know what to think. He thought it was odd that he never ran into Ron again. He thought it was odd how long it took him to realize something was wrong. He thought it was odd how long he was looking around. He looked around until it was almost sunrise.
When he finally remembered what he was doing, he came back over to the bench again. When he reached it, he looked down at the plants. He was confused. Ron had cleaned them up very well. There was not one weed left. He looked to the center again. There was nothing else. There were no leaves, no stems, no nothing. There was no way for him to find Ron. He looked at them for a long time. He scratched his head and looked around again. He came back to the bench. "It can't be," he said. "It is too good to be true. There has to be something wrong with this. I have seen this before. I have dreamed about this before. It is strange how these dreams have always come true." he said, "If this is real, it will come true again. I just have to wait."
Greg did not see Ron again. At least then he thought it was strange that he did not have a chance to talk to him. He met him when he woke up for the last time. He knew about his plan. He did not know what to think. It was different than the first time though. He talked to him like he was still his friend. He talked to him like they were going to be friends forever. He told him that it had all been a mistake. He told him that he loved him. He told him that it would be okay now. Greg was crying uncontrollably as he spoke to him. He talked about how much he loved him. He told him that he could not stay there with him any longer. He told him it was where he belonged. He told him that he was afraid to leave. He told him that he did not want to go. He told him that he was stuck there now and forever. He said, "Please forgive me. Please forgive me. I had to do it. I did not know how to make it better. I had to." He kept crying.
Greg sat back down on the bench. He was not sure what to do. This was not how it was supposed to be. All he wanted was to talk to him. He wanted to hear what he had to say. He just wanted to see him one more time. Greg could not believe this was all real. He wanted everything to be perfect for him. He had no clue how to make it happen though. He decided he was going to wait for him to come back.
It was going to be his greatest dream come true. He was going to see him again. He got comfortable on the bench. He made himself comfortable. He looked down at the plants. He could not believe he did that so well. He could not believe he got the look of them right. If they only knew. If they only knew what was going to happen. If they only knew that he had grown into a tree. Maybe they would have given him a chance. Maybe they would give him one more chance. Maybe he just missed his chance. Maybe it was going to be too late. Maybe it already was too late. Maybe he was wrong about all of this. Maybe he was wrong about everything. Maybe happiness was for everyone else. Maybe happiness was for someone else. Maybe he was happy for the wrong reasons. Maybe he was not ready for everything to be over yet. Maybe he was going to miss out on his greatest dream like everyone before him. Maybe everything was over now.
Greg closed his eyes and fell asleep. He hoped he would sleep well. He hoped he would dream again. He hoped he could see him again. He hoped this was all a real dream. He hoped it was all over. He thought he fell asleep. When he woke up he was happy that he had. He was happy he did not have another nightmare. He thought he had not had another nightmare in a long time. He almost did not want to fall asleep again though. He sat up on the bench again. He looked around at the Center. He did not see Ron again. He did not think he would. He got up and planned on walking the rest of the way back. He decided it was time for him to leave. There was nothing more for him to do. Nothing more for him to see.
He looked out at the plants again. They did look normal. They were healthy. They were beautiful. Greg did not believe it at first. Until he saw what he needed to see. It was Ron. Standing tall amongst the plants. He ran towards him and hugged him. He started laughing. He started crying. He stopped crying. He said to him, "Man, I missed you. I missed you. I am so sorry for what I did to you. I could not stand seeing you like that."
He wrapped his arms around him. He did not want to let go. He held him close to him. He wanted to cry some more. He knew he needed to stop it though. He did not want to stop it though. There was too much he was going to miss. It was too late. Greg choked back the tears. He could not go through it again. He did not want to lose his best friend again. Not this time. He looked at the plants again. He could not believe he was here. He did not think he would see him again. He did not think it was all over. He did not think it would be a dream. He did not think it would be another nightmare. He did not think it was real.
He told Ron he had to go. He told him he would return. He told him he loved him. He told him he was glad to see him again. He told him something funny. He told him how he always dreamed about coming. He told him how happy he was to see him again. He said, "I guess you can forgive me now. I guess I can stay here with you forever if that is what you want."
Ron smiled and reached his hand to the base of his tree. Ron said, "I do."
Greg was speechless. He told him he did not know what to say. He told him it was too good to be true. He told him he should have listened to him back then. He told him he was happy to see him again. He was happy he was there with him. He was happy it was not a dream. He told him there was no better time for it to be over than now. He told him there could not have been anything in that bag. He told him it was a terrible mistake. He told him that if he could go back and do it again, he would. He told him if he could change it he would. He told him he was sorry it had to end this way. He told him he had been wrong. He told him his worst nightmare was that. He told him it was over. He told him he could still see him. He told him he would never have to get away again. he told him that his greatest dream had come true.
Greg sat down on a bench. He looked at the plants again. They were beautiful. Ron was sitting next to him. He had not expected that. He did not think he was real. He did not think that any of it was real. Greg told him how he had always thought about doing that. He told him how it never worked out. He told him he never had a chance like this. He told him waking up to see him again was the best thing that ever happened to him. He told him he did not think it had. He told him he did not think there was more to it. He told him he did not think he was real. He told him he was still dreaming.
He hugged him. He was happy to see him again. He told him he needed him. He told him there was no one he would rather spend his time with. He told him he needed to find a way to save him. He told him he could not let him stay like that. He told him this was his dream. He told him there had to be a way to wake up. He told him no matter what he would find a way. He told him that he could not control anything else. Greg told him he could control what he did in his dreams. He told him he could not be trapped in this dream for the rest of his life.
He told him he just had to figure out how to wake himself up. He told him he just needed to wake up again. He told him he just needed to see him again. He told him he just had to. He told him he just had to figure out a way to wake himself up. He told him he was an amazing tree. He reminded him they all were. He told him they were amazing trees. He told him he was amazing. He told him there was no water. He told him there was no mirror. He told him there was a key. He told him he needed to find it. He told him he needed to find a way. He said he would. He told him he would try. He told him he would never stop looking. He told him he would try and come back. He told him he would come back. He told him he would find a way.
Greg got up. He told him he had to go. He told him he had to find the key. He told him he was sure he would. He told him everyone had a chance. He told him everyone had a chance to see him. He told him he could still save him. He told him he believed in him. He told him he never stopped believing in him. He told him he could find the key. He told him he hoped that he did. He told him he knew he would. He said it was a miracle he even got that close. He told him he knew he loved him.
He shook his hand. He told him he loved him. He told him he believed in him. He told him he was sorry he had to go. He told him he was glad to see him again. He told him he had to go. He told him he would never leave him again. He told him he knew he would. He told him he knew he would eventually figure it out. He told him he knew he would.
Greg woke up. He told him she knew he would.
He woke up again. He told him he knew he would.
He woke up again. It was too much for him to take. He could not handle it. He could not handle losing him again. He could not handle seeing him like that. He could not handle letting him go. He could not handle it.
He woke up again. This time he went to the bathroom. He drank some water. He went back to bed. He prayed there was a way. He prayed there was a way to save him. He stared at the wall. He did not sleep. He went back to bed. He wanted to look away. He wanted to stop seeing him like that. He prayed there was a way to save him. He prayed he found it. He prayed she kept him safe. He fell asleep. He woke up. He went back to the bathroom. He threw up. He went back to his dream.
