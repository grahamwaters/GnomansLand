<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This project is for fun :smile:. We are building a semi-open world virtual wilderness for our Gnomes. They live in a post-apocolypic survival society where they have to hunt and gather to stay alive.

There are many Interesting subtasks within this project:
* (Keeping it PG) Integration of Gnomes having children, resulting in attribute inheritence.
* Resource Optimization in the enviornment.
* Genetic Algorithm Application for the life of the Gnomes.

At the very least we are building a virtual space where Gnomes live and interact. They must gather to survive, and avoid dangers that are randomly placed throughout the action-space.
