# Gnoman's Land Reimagined

For this project, I will need to install the following Python packages:

Gym: Gym is a library for creating and managing environments for reinforcement learning agents. I will need Gym to create the game world for the agents to interact with.

Numpy: Numpy is a library for working with arrays and matrices of numerical data in Python. I will need Numpy to create and manipulate the 2D array of tiles representing the game world.

Pandas: Pandas is a library for working with tabular data in Python. I may find Pandas useful for storing and manipulating the data representing the agents and their actions in the game.

Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a library for creating visualizations of data in Python. I may find Matplotlib useful for creating graphs and other visualizations of the agents' learning and performance over time.

To install all of these packages, I can use the following command: `pip install gym numpy pandas matplotlib`

if I use conda I can use the following command: `conda install -c conda-forge gym numpy pandas matplotlib`

# Project Overview
This is a world simulation game with autonomous agents or "gnomes" that interact with each other and their environment to survive. The game is mostly autonomous as the agents have very limited interaction with the user. The user sets various parameters for the game and then watches the agents learn and evolve over time. The inspirations for the game come from a childhood fascination with the game "Age of Empires" and from hours spent playing "Minecraft" with my friends.
What my vision is for the game is an immersive simulation experience where we get to watch a civilization build itself from square one without knowing anything about how the world works.

chatGPT suggested a good approach the other day that I could take which was to use a method called a "genetic algorithm" to simulate the interactions and behaviors of the gnomes. In a genetic algorithm, I would define a set of rules and parameters for the gnomes to follow, such as how they gather food, mate, and defend themselves. I would then let the gnomes interact with each other and their environment, and use the principles of natural selection to evolve their behavior over time. The gnomes with the most successful behaviors would be more likely to survive and reproduce, passing their traits on to the next generation. Over time, this would lead to the emergence of complex and adaptive behavior in the gnomes.

In summary, GnomansLand is a simulation game that uses reinforcement learning to train an "Agent" character to explore and learn about its environment. The Agent can build tools, find resources, and navigate through the environment to survive. The game is written in the programming language Python and the code is available on GitHub. The game rewards the Agent for good actions and learns from bad ones with positive and negative reinforcements. The goal is for the Agent to learn as much as possible through exploration and experimentation to stay alive in the simulated environment.

In the future, the game could include a feature where the Agent may become "lost" if its confidence falls below a certain threshold. When this happens, the Agent would start randomly walking and lose more health than usual. This is not currently implemented in the base simulation but could be added in a future update.

# GPT Suggestions for Improvement and Future Work
Some suggestions for improving the project could include:

Using object-oriented programming (OOP) to model the different classes of the game (gnomes, environment, colony, etc.) and their interactions. This can help make the code more modular and easier to maintain and extend.
Implementing a reinforcement learning algorithm for the gnomes to learn from their experiences in the game environment. This can allow the gnomes to adapt and learn new skills and strategies over time.
Using Python best practices, such as using appropriate data types, following the PEP 8 style guide, and writing clear and concise code with helpful comments. This can make the code more readable and maintainable by other developers.
Testing the game mechanics and reinforcement learning algorithm to ensure that they work as intended and produce the desired results. This can help identify and fix any bugs or issues before the game is released.
Using scalable design patterns and techniques, such as modularity, abstraction, and separation of concerns, to enable the game to be easily expanded and enhanced in the future. This can make the game more adaptable and flexible to meet changing requirements and challenges.

# Storyline

The storyline of the game follows the character Greg, who is exploring and learning about his environment through the use of reinforcement learning. Greg encounters various challenges, such as a storm approaching, and must use his knowledge and skills to overcome them. He meets other characters, such as Ron, who help him along the way. The story follows Greg's adventures as he navigates his way through the world and learns to survive.

# Game Stages

Stage 1. Emergence
It all began when the first gnomes dared to venture out from their underground shelter into the open air of the world. A world left desolate after the war and ripe with new promises. Foundation had begun.
Stage one, your gnomes must survive the coming months by learning about their new home. This knowledge will prove crucial in the coming years of the foundling colony.
Rules of Stage One:
Gnomes that do not work do not eat.
Gnomes assigned to a task get better at the task over time.
Gnomes lose their experience points (one per day) when inactive.

Rewards

Eat food +10 Health
Completed a task plus one XP minus one Health
Found the food +2 XP +2 fame
Did not share plus one XP plus one fame
Did move plus one XP minus one Health
found an artifact plus 10XP plus five fame

Any references to "agent" are referring to a "gnome" in this outline.

Punishments
did not eat minus one Health
If the agent does not work, they lose two health points.
If the agent did not find food, they lose one XP point.
if the agent did not share, they lose two XP
if the agent did not move, they lose two XP and one Health


Stage 2. Descartes Station

They found a world abandoned by its previous inhabitants. Whole cities were left empty, with a very small number of their buildings left intact. So they made their way to a place they would name Neo Valley, which contained a large building in the center that used to be the city hall. They built from these stones and what remained of the ancient temple, a base that they aptly named Descartes Station, for it was there that they began to think and, thus, to "be".

Rules of Stage 2
There are new rules that are added to the rules previously in place for stage one.

Rule 1 bring food back to the base before eating
rule 2 explore new territory
rule 3 build the city
rule 4 reproduce


Stage 3. What hides in the hills

Quite by accident, one of the gnomes stumbles upon a strange cave that had been sealed before the war with brick and mortar that had long since been eroded away, leaving only a plaque inscribed in an unknown language. He is curious and ventures inside. Suddenly an avalanche begins, and falling rock breaks open the stronghold hidden within the dark mountains. From that fortress of stone, many ancient enemies visit Neo Valley and strike Descartes Station. Despite their position, nestled between the black cliffs, they are not safe. Foreign enemies and monsters lurk in the mountains, intent on ensuring that Neo Valley remains a Gnomans Land in perpetuity. Their actions lead to the formation of a league of warriors known as the Order of the Eves Protectorate.

The creed of Eve's protectorate is formed with the creed "Patrol, investigate, defend, and kill."

New Rules
ten of the agents are designated as members of the Order and are given armor that was found in a strange chest hidden in one of the city's ruined buildings. They have extra Health and food, and that's more fame than their fellow agents. They designate 1 of their number, named Phineas, to train the defenders in the ways of the legendary Assipattle doctrine, and the members of this new Order learn, so do their opponent agents in the environment and the agents that have a "defender role" in the population.

They constantly patrol together and follow the creed to their very deaths.

Several roles emerge in the agent population:

1.	the defenders
2.	the hunter-gatherers
3.	the city builders who repair and build new houses
4.	The masons
5.	the nurturers and healers (or the family builders).

Rules of stage 3

1.	Ten gnomes must be in the Order at all times.
a.	This means that if one dies, the top candidate must be taken from the defenders to join the Order.
2.	No exploration of the environment can occur without a guard.
3.	Build the city and repair the walls as enemies damage them.
4.	Only reproduce when not under attack.


Stage 4. The dull Roar of War

The creatures of Neo Valley refuse to relinquish their new home and fight back against the invaders from their base. It is a hard battle and one they may not win. To succeed, they must follow an old sage's instructions from times before the war. The sage is known only by the name Dryden.

Stage 5. Growing Pains
Just when most of the beasts from the hills are defeated, the food reserves from the shelter begin to fall short, and the valley is plunged into famine. Reeling from the war, they must learn to grow crops, hunt, and gather to stay alive. The plants seemingly clean the air, allowing them to stop wearing their gas masks. It feels so odd to go without them. It is an entirely new form of war, forcing the creatures to adapt and learn to survive in times of peace.

Rules
1.	All the rules of stages one through 4 apply.
2.	Now 20 gnomes must be in the Order at all times.
3.	One of these agents is a trainer agent that trains an apprentice with new knowledge from the Order's learned policies based on their experiences in the environment.
4.	There must be no exploration during times of war.
5.	Continue repairing the walls and building the city.
6.	Only reproduce when there is enough food and no enemy is attacking.


Stage 6. The Pox of Thaddeus the Bard

In the final chapter of the Beginning for Neo Valley, the remaining families are visited by a strange creature calling himself Thaddeus the Bard, who limps into town one day with stories about an unknown ailment that has decimated one of the other surviving colonies. He calls the medical condition thick breath, and before he can say anything else, collapses in exhaustion. He dies the next day, and suddenly members of the community are stricken with the illness. It will be the ultimate test of their survivability. An enemy that attacks from within.

Those who stop learning stop living

# Game Mechanics
The game mechanics of GnomansLand involve the use of a reinforcement learning algorithm that programs the gnomes' reactions to stimuli in their environment. The algorithm rewards the gnomes for good actions and punishes them for bad actions, helping them to learn how to survive and thrive in their new home. The mechanics also include the use of a task system, where the gnomes can learn new skills by completing tasks, and a system for tracking the gnomes' health, experience, and other attributes.

# Response

In GnomansLand, the player controls a colony of gnomes in a post-apocalyptic world. The game is divided into six phases, each with its own unique challenges for the gnomes. The player's goal is to ensure that their population of gnomes survive and thrive through each phase in order to advance to the next.

The game mechanics for GnomansLand include a reinforcement learning algorithm that programs the gnomes' reactions to stimuli in their environment. The algorithm takes into account the actions of the gnomes, the consequences of those actions, and the rewards or punishments associated with them. Good actions, such as working, exploring, and building, result in rewards such as increased experience points, health, and fame. Bad actions, such as not working or not sharing, result in punishments such as decreased health and experience points.

The gnomes learn to survive and thrive in their new home by completing tasks and gaining experience points. As they complete tasks, they learn new skills such as hunting, gathering, building, and defending. These skills are necessary for the gnomes to survive and thrive in their new environment.

The health, experience, and other attributes of the gnomes are tracked through a system of variables.

The gnome class will need to have several attributes to track health, including:

Health: a numerical value that represents the gnome's current health level.
Maximum health: a numerical value that represents the gnome's maximum health level.
Health regeneration rate: a numerical value that represents the rate at which the gnome's health regenerates over time.
Health regeneration delay: a numerical value that represents the delay between health regeneration events.
Health regeneration threshold: a numerical value that represents the minimum health level required for the gnome to begin regenerating health.


The health of each gnome is determined by their actions, with good actions resulting in increased health and bad actions resulting in decreased health. Experience points are gained through completing tasks and lost through inactivity. Other attributes, such as fame and strength, are also tracked and can affect the gnomes' abilities and chances of survival.

In addition to these attributes, the gnome class may also need to have attributes for tracking the gnome's experience level and any special abilities or skills that they have learned. These attributes may be used to determine the gnome's overall strength and effectiveness in various tasks and challenges.

The rules of each phase dictate the specific challenges and goals that the gnomes must overcome in order to advance.


In Stage 1, for example, the rules state that gnomes must work in order to eat and that inactive gnomes lose experience points.

In Stage 2, the rules dictate that food must be brought back to the base before being eaten and that the city must be built and expanded.

In Stage 3, the rules state that the gnomes must defend the city from enemies and that they must reproduce when not under attack.

In stage 4, known as the "dull roar of war," the gnomes must defend their home against invaders. The following are the rules for this stage:

At least ten gnomes must be members of the Order of the Eves Protectorate at all times. If a member of the Order dies, the next highest ranked defender must be promoted to the Order.
No exploration of the environment can occur without a guard.
The city must be repaired and fortified as needed to defend against enemy attacks.
Gnomes can only reproduce when not under attack.
To implement these rules in a gnome class using object-oriented programming (OOP) best practices, the following steps can be taken:

Define a Gnome class that includes attributes for the gnome's health, experience, and any other relevant attributes such as rank within the Order of the Eves Protectorate.
Define a defend() method for the Gnome class that allows the gnome to defend against enemy attacks. This method should take into account the gnome's health, experience, and any other relevant attributes in determining the effectiveness of their defense.
Define a reproduce() method for the Gnome class that allows the gnome to reproduce, but only if they are not currently under attack. This method should update the population of gnomes within the game.
Define a repair() method for the Gnome class that allows the gnome to repair and fortify the city. This method should take into account the gnome's experience and any other relevant attributes in determining the effectiveness of their repairs.
Within the game's main logic, implement checks to ensure that at least ten gnomes are members of the Order at all times, and that no exploration occurs without a guard. Also implement checks to ensure that gnomes can only reproduce when not under attack.
Continuously track the gnomes' health, experience, and other attributes, and use these attributes in conjunction with the methods defined in the Gnome class to simulate the rules of stage 4.

The rules of the game as a whole dictate the overall objectives and challenges that the gnomes must face. These rules include the requirement to maintain a certain population size, the need to explore and build, and the need to defend against enemies. By following these rules and using their skills and abilities, the gnomes can survive and thrive in their new home.


# The Stages in OOP terms

In stage 1 of the game, the player's gnome population must survive the coming months by learning about their new home. This knowledge will be crucial in the coming years of the foundling colony. The rules of stage 1 are as follows:

- Gnomes that do not work do not eat.
- Gnomes assigned to a task get better at the task over time.
- Gnomes lose their experience points (one per day) when inactive.

To enforce these rules, we will create a Gnome class with the following attributes:

```python
class Gnome:
    def __init__(self):
        self.health = 100
        self.experience = 0
        self.is_working = False

    def work(self):
        self.is_working = True
        self.experience += 1

    def rest(self):
        self.is_working = False
        self.experience -= 1
```
The Gnome class has initial health of 100 and experience of 0. The work() method sets the is_working attribute to True and increases the experience attribute by 1. The rest() method sets the is_working attribute to False and decreases the experience attribute by 1.

To track the health of the gnomes and ensure that they are working and eating, we will create a Colony class with the following methods:

```python
class Colony:
    def __init__(self):
        self.gnomes = []

    def add_gnome(self, gnome):
        self.gnomes.append(gnome)

    def feed_gnomes(self):
        for gnome in self.gnomes:
            if gnome.is_working:
                gnome.health += 10

    def enforce_rules(self):
        for gnome in self.gnomes:
            if not gnome.is_working:
                gnome.health -= 2
```
The Colony class has an empty list of gnomes that can be added with the add_gnome() method. The feed_gnomes() method increases the health of all working gnomes by 10. The enforce_rules() method decreases the health of all non-working gnomes by 2.

To use these classes, we can create a Gnome instance and add it to a Colony instance like so:

```python
# Create a gnome
greg = Gnome()

# Create a colony and add the gnome to it
neo_valley = Colony()
neo_valley.add_gnome(greg)
```

To simulate a day in the life of the gnome population, we can use the work(), rest(), feed_gnomes(), and enforce_rules() methods like so:

```python
# Have the gnomes work
greg.work()

# Feed the working gnomes
neo_valley.feed_gnomes()

# Enforce the rules (non-working gnomes lose health)
neo_valley.enforce_rules()

# Have the gnomes rest
greg.rest()
```

In stage 2, the gnomes must continue to survive and thrive in their new home, but new challenges and opportunities arise. The rules for stage 2 are as follows:

The gnomes must continue to eat food to maintain their health.
The gnomes must continue to complete tasks to gain experience and improve their skills.
Gnomes will lose their experience points at a faster rate if they are inactive.
The gnomes must explore new territory to expand their knowledge of the environment and uncover new resources.
The gnomes must work together to build the city and construct new buildings.
The gnomes may reproduce, but only when resources allow for it and the population is not under attack.
To implement these rules in OOP best practices, we would create a Gnome class with attributes for tracking the gnome's health, experience, and other relevant information. We would also create methods for each of the actions the gnomes can take, such as eat(), explore(), and build(), and use conditionals and other OOP principles to enforce the rules of the game. For example, a Gnome object's eat() method might look like this:

```python
def eat(self):
    if self.has_food:
        self.health += 10
        self.has_food = False
    else:
        self.health -= 1
```
This method would increase the gnome's health by 10 if it has food, but decrease it by 1 if it does not. By using similar methods and conditionals for the other actions, we can enforce the rules of stage 2 and allow the gnomes to navigate the challenges and opportunities of this phase of the game.

In stage 3, the gnomes must continue to survive and thrive in their new home, but new challenges and opportunities arise.

The rules for stage 3 of GnomansLand are as follows:

Ten gnomes must be designated as members of the Order of the Eves Protectorate at all times. This means that if one dies, the top candidate must be chosen from the defenders to join the Order.

No exploration of the environment can occur without a guard from the Order accompanying the exploration party.

The city must be built and repaired as necessary, with the walls being reinforced to withstand attacks from enemies.

Reproduction is only allowed when the gnomes are not under attack.

The Order must patrol the territory and follow the creed of "Patrol, investigate, defend, and kill" in order to protect the gnomes and their city.

The defenders, hunter-gatherers, city builders, masons, and nurturers must all work together in order to ensure the survival and prosperity of the gnome population.

The reinforcement learning algorithm must take into account the actions of the gnomes and their effects on their health, experience, and other attributes. Good actions, such as gathering food and defending the city, will be rewarded with increased experience and improved attributes. Bad actions, such as not working or not sharing resources, will be punished with decreased experience and impaired attributes.

The gnomes will learn to survive and thrive in their new home by completing tasks and learning new skills. These skills may include building and repairing the city, gathering food, and defending against enemies.

The gnomes' health, experience, and other attributes will be tracked using variables within the gnome class. Health will be decreased by actions such as not eating or being injured in battle, and can be increased by eating food or using healing abilities. Experience will be gained by completing tasks and performing good actions, and will be lost by not working or not sharing resources. Other attributes, such as strength and intelligence, may be improved through the completion of tasks and the acquisition of new skills.

Overall, the rules for stage 3 of GnomansLand require the gnomes to work together in order to defend their city and protect their population from enemies. The reinforcement learning algorithm will help the gnomes to make good decisions and improve their chances of survival.

In OOP terms, stage 3 in GnomansLand would be represented by defining a class for the environment and a class for the agents (gnomes) that live in that environment. The environment class would have attributes and methods for representing the state of the environment, such as the state of the city, the presence of enemies, and the state of the city walls. The agent class would have attributes and methods for representing the state of each individual gnome, such as their health, experience, and skills.

## OOP Discussion for stage 3
The game mechanics for stage 3 would be implemented in the methods of these classes. For example, the environment class could have a method for simulating an enemy attack, which would update the state of the city and city walls accordingly. The agent class could have methods for carrying out tasks, such as gathering food or repairing city walls, which would update the gnome's attributes and skills based on their actions.

In addition to these core classes, stage 3 could also include additional classes for representing the Order of the Eves Protectorate and the various roles that the gnomes can take on, such as defenders, hunter-gatherers, and city builders. These classes would have their own attributes and methods for simulating the actions and behaviors of their respective roles.

Overall, the OOP implementation of stage 3 in GnomansLand would involve creating classes to represent the key components of the environment and the agents, and defining methods for simulating their actions and behaviors according to the rules of the game.

```python
# Stage 3 of GnomansLand
# This stage is marked by the discovery of an ancient stronghold hidden within the mountains of Neo Valley
# The gnomes must defend their home against the ancient enemies that emerge from the stronghold

# First, we create a new class called `Enemy` to represent the ancient enemies
class Enemy:
    # The enemies have extra health and food, as well as more fame than the gnomes
    health = 10
    food = 10
    fame = 10

    # The enemies can attack and damage the gnomes' city
    def attack(self, city):
        city.health -= 5

# We also create a new class called `Order` to represent the league of warriors formed by the gnomes
# These warriors are called the "Order of the Eves Protectorate"
class Order:
    # The Order has a list of members, which are gnomes with extra health and food, as well as more fame
    members = []

    # The Order has a creed: "Patrol, investigate, defend, and kill"
    # This creed guides the actions of the Order members
    creed = "Patrol, investigate, defend, and kill"

    # The Order trains its members in the ways of the legendary Assipattle doctrine
    def train(self):
        for member in self.members:
            member.health += 1
            member.food += 1
            member.fame += 1

    # The Order constantly patrols together and follows the creed to protect the city
    def patrol(self, city):
        for member in self.members:
            # The members investigate any potential threats
            threats = city.investigate()
            for threat in threats:
                # If a threat is found, the members defend the city against it
                threat.attack(city)
                # If necessary, the members will kill the threat to protect the city
                if city.health <= 0:
                    threat.health = 0


# In the main game loop, we create an instance of the `Order` class and add 10 gnomes to its list of members
order = Order()
for i in range(10):
    order.members.append(gnome)

# The Order trains its members in the ways of the Assipattle doctrine
order.train()

# In the main game loop, the Order patrols and protects the city from any threats
while True:
    order.patrol(city)

# In the `Gnome` class, we add a new attribute called `role` to keep track of each gnome's role in the colony
class Gnome:
    # The gnome's role can be one of the following:
    # "defender" - a member of the Order of the Eves Protectorate
    # "gatherer" - a hunter-gatherer who finds food for the colony
    # "builder" - a city builder who repairs and builds new houses
    # "mason" - a mason who works with stone to build the city
    # "nurturer" - a nurturer and healer who cares for the family
    role = ""

    # The gnome's health, food, and fame are tracked as before
    health = 0
    food = 0
    fame = 0

    # The gnome's experience is also tracked as before
    experience = 0

    # The gnome can complete tasks to gain experience and improve their skills
    def complete_task(self):
        self.experience += 1

    # continue this in a bit...
```

# Stage 4 - The Dull Roar of War
In Stage 4 of the game, the creatures of Neo Valley are fighting back against the invaders from their base. This stage of the game involves a war between the gnomes and the creatures of Neo Valley.

To represent this stage of the game in OOP terms, we will need to update the Gnome class to include attributes and methods related to combat and warfare. We will also need to update the Environment class to include the creatures of Neo Valley and their behavior.

Here is an example of how this could be implemented in Python3:
```python
# Gnome class
class Gnome:
    def __init__(self, name, health, strength, defense, intelligence):
        self.name = name
        self.health = health
        self.strength = strength
        self.defense = defense
        self.intelligence = intelligence

    # method for gnome to attack a creature
    def attack(self, creature):
        damage = self.strength - creature.defense
        creature.health -= damage
        print(f"{self.name} attacked {creature.name} for {damage} damage.")

    # method for gnome to defend against attack
    def defend(self):
        self.defense = self.defense * 2
        print(f"{self.name} is now in a defensive stance.")

    # method for gnome to use intelligence to gain an advantage in combat
    def use_intelligence(self):
        if self.intelligence > 5:
            print(f"{self.name} used their intelligence to gain an advantage in combat.")
        else:
            print(f"{self.name} was not intelligent enough to gain an advantage in combat.")

# Environment class
class Environment:
    def __init__(self, name, creatures):
        self.name = name
        self.creatures = creatures

    # method for creatures to attack gnomes
    def creature_attack(self, gnome):
        for creature in self.creatures:
            if random.random() < creature.attack_rate:
                creature.attack(gnome)

# Creature class
class Creature:
    def __init__(self, name, health, strength, defense, attack_rate):
        self.name = name
        self.health = health
        self.strength = strength
        self.defense = defense
        self.attack_rate = attack_rate

    # method for creature to attack a gnome
    def attack(self, gnome):
        damage = self.strength - gnome.defense
        gnome.health -= damage
        print(f"{self.name} attacked {gnome.name} for {damage} damage.")
```

# Stage 5 - Growing Pains
To implement the rules of stage 5 in OOP terms, we can make the following changes to the gnome, environment, colony, and other classes:

First, we can add a new attribute to the gnome class called role which will be a string that can be either "defender", "trainer", or "apprentice". This will allow us to differentiate between the different roles of the gnomes in the Order and apply different rules to each group.

```python
class Gnome:
    def __init__(self):
        # ... Other attributes
        self.role = None
```
Next, we can update the environment class to have a new attribute called war which will be a boolean value indicating whether the gnomes are currently at war with enemies. We can also add a new method called is_safe_to_explore() which will return False if the war attribute is True, and True otherwise.

```python
class Environment:
    def __init__(self):
        # ... Other attributes
        self.war = False

    def is_safe_to_explore(self):
        return not self.war
```
We can also update the colony class to have a new method called train_apprentices() which will iterate through the gnomes and find the trainer and apprentice gnomes. The trainer will then pass on its learned knowledge to the apprentice.

```python

class Colony:
    def __init__(self):
        # ... Other attributes
        self.gnomes = []

    def train_apprentices(self):
        trainer = None
        apprentice = None
        for gnome in self.gnomes:
            if gnome.role == "trainer":
                trainer = gnome
            elif gnome.role == "apprentice":
                apprentice = gnome

        if trainer and apprentice:
            # Pass on knowledge from trainer to apprentice
            pass

```

Finally, we can update the rules of the game to reflect the changes in stage 5. We can do this by adding a new method to the colony class called update_rules() which will be called every time the game updates. This method will check the current state of the environment and update the rules accordingly.

```python
class Colony:
    def __init__(self):
        # ... Other attributes
        self.gnomes = []
        self.rules = []

    def update_rules(self):
        if self.environment.war:
            # During times of war, only the defenders and trainers can move
            self.rules = ["defender", "trainer"]
        else:
            # During times of peace, all gnomes can move
            self.rules = ["defender", "trainer", "apprentice", "hunter-gatherer", "city-builder", "mason", "nurturer"]

    def train_apprentices(self):
        # ... Previous code

    def update(self):
        self.update_rules()
        self.train_apprentices()
        # ... Previous code
```

# Stage 6 - The Pox of Thaddeus the Bard

## The rules for stage 6 are as follows:

All the rules of stages one through 5 apply.

Now 30 gnomes must be in the Order at all times.

Two of these agents are designated as healers, trained in the ways of medicine to help combat the illness.
No exploration is allowed until the illness is under control.
Continue building the city and repairing the walls.
Only reproduce when there is enough food and no enemy is attacking.

Any gnomes that contract the illness must be isolated from the rest of the population to prevent further spread.
The following changes would need to be made to the gnome, environment, colony, and other classes to incorporate the rules for stage 6:

Gnome class

A new attribute, "health_status", would need to be added to track whether a gnome is healthy or has contracted the illness.
A new method, "treat_illness()", would need to be added to allow the healers to treat gnomes with the illness.

Environment class

A new attribute, "illness_status", would need to be added to track the spread of the illness in the population.
A new method, "spread_illness()", would need to be added to simulate the spread of the illness among the gnomes.

Colony class

A new attribute, "healers", would need to be added to track the number of healers in the colony.

A new method, "treat_illness()", would need to be added to allow the healers to treat gnomes with the illness.
The "reproduce()" method would need to be updated to only allow reproduction if there is enough food and no enemy is attacking, and if the illness is under control.
Other classes

A new class, "Illness", could be created to track the spread and treatment of the illness in the population. This class could have attributes such as "infected_gnomes" and "healed_gnomes" and methods such as "spread()" and "treat()" to simulate the spread and treatment of the illness.


# OOP Design


For stage 1, the gnome class will need methods for working, eating, finding food, and sharing food. These methods will be used to track the gnomes' actions and determine their rewards and punishments.

For stage 2, the gnome class will need to include methods for exploring new territory and building the city. These methods will be used to allow the gnomes to expand their territory and build their city, which will be crucial for their survival.

For stage 3, the gnome class will need to include methods for patrolling, investigating, defending, and killing. These methods will be used by the Order of the Eves Protectorate to defend the city from enemies and monsters.

For stage 4, the gnome class will need to include methods for growing crops, hunting, and gathering food. These methods will be used to help the gnomes survive the famine and thrive in times of peace.

For stage 5, the gnome class will need to include methods for training apprentices and sharing knowledge. These methods will be used by the trainer agent to teach new knowledge to the apprentice agents in the Order.

For stage 6, the gnome class will need to include methods for dealing with illness and spreading disease. These methods will be used to simulate the spread of the thick breath illness and test the gnomes' ability to survive and thrive in the face of a deadly disease.

## Gnome Class Design
I think that the gnome class will change over the phases, and more abilities will be granted to the gnomes over time.
here is a preliminary design for the gnome class:

```output
Gnome class:
    |
    |--- attributes:
    |        |
    |        |--- health

    |
    |--- phases:
    |        |
    |        |--- stage 1:

    |        |       |--- methods:
    |        |       |        |--- explore()
    |        |       |        |--- build()
    |        |
    |        |--- stage 3:
    |        |       |--- methods:
    |        |       |        |--- explore()
    |        |       |        |--- build()
    |        |       |        |--- defend()
    |        |
    |        |--- stage 4:
    |        |       |--- methods:
    |        |       |        |--- build()
    |        |       |        |--- defend()
    |        |       |        |--- fight()
    |        |       |        |--- reproduce()
    |        |
    |        |--- stage 5:
    |        |       |--- methods:
    |        |       |        |--- build()
    |        |       |        |--- defend()
    |        |       |        |--- fight()
    |        |       |        |--- grow_crops()
    |        |       |        |--- hunt()
    |        |       |        |--- gather()
    |        |       |        |--- reproduce()
    |        |
    |        |--- stage 6:
    |        |       |--- methods:
    |        |       |        |--- build()
    |        |       |        |--- defend()
    |        |       |        |--- fight()
    |        |       |        |--- grow_crops()
    |        |       |        |--- hunt()
    |        |       |        |--- gather()
    |        |       |        |--- reproduce()
    |        |       |        |--- heal()
```
Workshopping this with chatGPT, we came up with some improvements to the class design.

It looks like the gnome class is a good start. Some additional methods that may be useful to include are:

train(): This method can be used to train the gnomes in the Order of the Eves Protectorate on the Assipattle doctrine. This can be used in stage 3 to train the defenders on their combat skills.
heal(): This method can be used to heal other gnomes in the colony who have been injured in combat or struck by the illness. This can be used in stage 6 to help combat the spread of the thick breath illness.
repair(): This method can be used to repair the walls of the city that have been damaged by enemy attacks. This can be used in stages 3 and 4 to maintain the integrity of the city's defenses.
Additionally, it may be useful to add attributes to the gnome class to track things like the gnomes' combat proficiency, farming ability, and healing skills. These attributes can be used to determine which gnomes are best suited for certain tasks and roles in the colony.



```python
class Gnome:
    def __init__(self, name, health, experience, fame, happiness, confidence, personality, task):
        self.name = name
        self.health = health
        self.experience = experience
        self.fame = fame
        self.happiness = happiness
        self.confidence = confidence
        self.personality = personality
        self.task = task

    def work(self):
        # Update the gnome's task experience
        pass

    def eat(self):
        # Increase the gnome's health
        pass

    def explore(self):
        # Update the gnome's confidence and experience
        pass

    def rest(self):
        # Increase the gnome's happiness and health
        pass

    def reproduce(self):
        # Create a new gnome with similar attributes
        pass

    def train(self):
        # Increase the gnome's experience and task proficiency
        pass


class Environment:
    def __init__(self, food, enemies, artifacts, tasks, weather):
        self.food = food
        self.enemies = enemies
        self.artifacts = artifacts
        self.tasks = tasks
        self.weather = weather

    def update(self):
        # Update the environment based on the current phase
        pass

    def check_for_enemies(self):
        # Check if there are enemies in the environment
        pass

    def check_for_food(self):
        # Check if there is food in the environment
        pass

    def check_for_artifacts(self):
        # Check if there are artifacts in the environment
        pass

    def check_for_tasks(self):
        # Check if there are tasks to be completed in the environment
        pass

    def check_weather(self):
        # Check the current weather conditions
        pass


class Colony:
    def __init__(self, gnomes, order, city, walls):
        self.gnomes = gnomes
        self.order = order
        self.
```

# Stage One

Some of the object oriented design for the first stage of the project. This is a work in progress and will be updated as we go.


# Gnome Class
```python
class Gnome:
    def __init__(self, health, experience, fame):
        self.health = health
        self.experience = experience
        self.fame = fame
        self.personality_threshold = 0.5
        self.confidence_attribute = 0

    def work(self):
        # code to implement the "work" action

    def find_food(self):
        # code to implement the "find food" action

    def share(self):
        # code to implement the "share" action

    def move(self):
        # code to implement the "move" action

    def explore(self):
        # code to implement the "explore" action

    def reproduce(self):
        # code to implement the "reproduce" action
```

*me:*
Nice, I notice you added a confidence threshold, what does that do exactly? Make the gnome more confident in it's choices?

*chatGPT:*
The confidence attribute and personality threshold are used to determine whether a gnome is feeling confident in their actions and decisions. When a gnome's confidence is high, they are more likely to take risks and explore new areas, while a low confidence level may cause the gnome to become more cautious and stick to familiar paths. The personality threshold is a threshold that the gnome's confidence must be above in order to take certain actions, such as exploring new areas or engaging in combat. If a gnome's confidence falls below their personality threshold, they may become "lost" and begin wandering randomly, losing more health than usual. This is not implemented in the base simulation but could be included in a more advanced version.


In stage 1, the gnomes are just beginning to explore their new home and are focused on finding food and staying alive. The methods available to them at this stage include work(), find_food(), share(), move(), and explore(). These methods will allow the gnomes to gather resources, complete tasks, and learn about their environment.

As the game progresses and the gnomes enter new stages, additional methods will be added to the gnome class to reflect the challenges and opportunities that arise in those stages. For example, in stage 3, the defend() method will be added to allow the gnomes to protect their city from enemy attacks. In stage 4, the fight() method will be added to allow the gnomes to engage in combat with enemy creatures. And in stage 5, the grow_crops(), hunt(), and gather() methods will be added to allow the gnomes to produce their own food and sustain their colony.

# Environment Class
```python
Here is a tree-map diagram of the Environment class for the Game:

Copy code
Environment
  |
  |--- attributes:
  |        |
  |        |--- food_supply
  |        |--- enemies
  |        |--- terrain
  |
  |--- methods:
  |        |
  |        |--- explore()
  |        |--- find_food()
  |        |--- fight()
  |        |--- grow_crops()
  |        |--- hunt()
  |        |--- gather()
```

This diagram shows the attributes and methods of the Environment class. The food_supply attribute tracks the amount of food available in the environment, while the enemies attribute keeps track of the number and type of enemy creatures present. The terrain attribute represents the terrain and geography of the environment. The explore() method allows the gnomes to explore the environment and discover new resources, while the find_food() method allows the gnomes to locate and gather food. The fight() method enables the gnomes to engage in combat with enemy creatures, while the grow_crops() method allows the gnomes to cultivate crops to provide food for the colony. The hunt() method enables the gnomes to hunt animals for food, and the gather() method allows the gnomes to collect other resources from the environment, such as wood or stone.

## But what goes into an environment?

The environment class in a reinforcement learning (RL) project typically represents the environment in which the RL agents operate and interact with. This class typically includes methods for the agents to perform actions in the environment, such as moving to a new location or interacting with objects, as well as methods for the environment to provide feedback to the agents in the form of rewards or punishments. The environment class may also include attributes such as the current state of the environment, the current location of the agents, and any objects or obstacles in the environment.

Me: so, should we hard-code punishments and rewards into the environment or into entity classes that live in that space?

For example what if I am creating an environment that is a desert and there are ants that live in the desert. Would I create a class for the Ant first period then if there are any enemies to be ants in the environment like snakes then would I create a snake class for the snake entity that moves around in the same environment?

AI:
```
Typically, in reinforcement learning, punishments and rewards are defined within the environment class. This is because the environment is responsible for determining which actions are good or bad, and how the agent should be rewarded or punished based on their actions.

In the example you provided, the environment class could define the rewards and punishments for the ants' actions. For instance, if an ant successfully finds food, it could be rewarded with a positive reinforcement. If an ant comes into contact with a snake, it could be punished with a negative reinforcement.

The ant and snake classes would then be responsible for implementing the behavior of the agents within the environment. These classes would define the actions that the agents can take, such as moving around in the environment or interacting with other objects.

It is also possible to define rewards and punishments within the individual agent classes, depending on the specific design of the game. However, in most cases, it is more intuitive and logical to define them within the environment class.
```
Me: Okay, so for the first stage of the game where the gnomes first enter the world how would we design a gym environment for them to live in? I want to use Gym instead of PyGame because it is much more useful for multi-agent RL applications.

In your response please use the previous inputs that I have provided you for context about the first stage and what that means for the agents.

AI:
```
To create a gym environment for the first stage of the game, we would need to define the state space, action space, and rewards for the gnomes. The state space would include information about the environment, such as the location of food and other resources, the status of the gnomes' health and experience, and any other relevant information. The action space would include the actions that the gnomes can take, such as exploring, working, finding food, and sharing. The rewards would need to be defined based on the rules of the game, such as giving positive rewards for completing tasks and finding food, and negative rewards for not working or not sharing food.

To implement this gym environment, we would first create a class for the environment, which would initialize the state space and action space, and provide methods for the gnomes to take actions and receive rewards. We would also need to create a class for the gnomes, which would keep track of their attributes and allow them to take actions in the environment. In the first stage, the gnomes would only have the ability to explore, work, find food, and share, so these actions would be included in the action space and implemented in the gnome class. The environment would then provide rewards based on the rules of the game, such as giving positive rewards for completing tasks and finding food, and negative rewards for not working or not sharing food.

Overall, the gym environment for the first stage of the game would need to include the state space, action space, and rewards, and would be implemented through classes for the environment and the gnomes. These classes would provide the necessary methods and attributes for the gnomes to interact with their environment and learn to survive in their new world.
```

Okay, I am going to start this now.
