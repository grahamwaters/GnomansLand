# Gnoman's Land Reimagined

For this project, you will need to install the following Python packages:

Pygame: Pygame is a library for creating games and other graphical applications in Python. You will need Pygame to create the game world and display it on the screen.
Numpy: Numpy is a library for working with arrays and matrices of numerical data in Python. You will need Numpy to create and manipulate the 2D array of tiles representing the game world.
Pandas: Pandas is a library for working with tabular data in Python. You may find Pandas useful for storing and manipulating the data representing the agents and their actions in the game.
Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a library for creating visualizations of data in Python. You may find Matplotlib useful for creating graphs and other visualizations of the agents' learning and performance over time.

To install all of these packages, you can use the following command: pip install pygame numpy pandas matplotlib

Here is a suggested file structure for this project:

Copy code
gnomans_land/
├── src/
│   ├── gnome.py
│   ├── environment.py
│   ├── main.py
│   └── rules_and_requirements.py
└── images/
    └── logo.png
This file structure includes the following files:

gnome.py: This file will contain the code for the Gnome class, which will represent the agents in the game.
environment.py: This file will contain the code for the Environment class, which will represent the game world and its objects and features.
main.py: This file will contain the main script for the game, which will manage the overall flow of the game and coordinate the interactions between the agents and the environment.
rules_and_requirements.py: This file will contain the code for the RulesAndRequirements class, which will define the rules and requirements for the game. This will include the actions available to the agents, the rewards and punishments associated with these actions, and the conditions for ending the game.
You can also include additional files and subdirectories as needed to organize your code and other assets for the project. For example, you may want to create a subdirectory for storing images or other media files used in the game. Consult the Pygame documentation for more information on how to use images and other media in your game.

In the gnome.py file, you will define the Gnome class, which represents the gnome agent in the game. The Gnome class has the following attributes and methods:

x: The x-coordinate of the gnome's position.
y: The y-coordinate of the gnome's position.
carrying: The type of item the gnome is currently carrying. This can be None if the gnome is not carrying any items.
__init__(): The constructor for the Gnome class. This method initializes the gnome with a starting position and sets carrying to None.
move(): This method moves the gnome to a new position in the game world.
act(): This method is called when the gnome needs to take an action in the game world, such as moving or picking up an item.
render(): This method renders the gnome to the screen.
